          Johnny's in the basement<br />
          Mixing up the medicine<br />
          I'm on the pavement<br />
          Thinking about the government<br />
          The man in the trench coat<br />
          Badge out, laid off<br />
          Says he's got a bad cough<br />
          Wants to get it paid off<br />
          Look out kid<br />
          It's somethin' you did<br />
          God knows when<br />
          But you're doing it again<br />
          You better duck down the alley way<br />
          Lookin' for a new friend<br />
          A man in the coonskin cap, in the pig pen<br />
          Wants eleven dollar bills, you only got ten
