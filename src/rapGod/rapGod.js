            Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human<br />
            What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman<br />
            Innovative and I'm made of rubber<br />
            So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you<br />
            I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating<br />
            How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating<br />
            Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting<br />
            For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating<br />
            'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated<br />
            I make elevating music, you make elevator music
        </p>
